At areno.so, we believe in the power of collaboration and shared knowledge. We are passionate about building open technology that inspires, connects, and transforms realities.

Every line of code here is an invitation to imagine a freer, more inclusive, and sustainable futureâ€”together. We are driven by curiosity, creativity, and the desire to make a positive mark on the global community.

Are you excited about open source? Join us! At areno.so, there is always room for new ideas, friendly hands, and restless minds.

_Pssst... Stay tuned! Our very first open project will be a custom component library, crafted to empower creators and spark innovation._
